<h1>Fuuka Is Best Girl</h1>

<h3>Now Worship Her Bitch</h3>

<div class = "par">

<p>Fuuka is best girl of persona 3, and there is nothing you can say to dispute this fact.<br>
Others may say that Aigis the Robot Bitch, or Yukari the Useless Shit, or Mitsuru the Emo Ass Bitch are better, but you are all stoopid.<br>
To become a big brian intellectual, you must learn to accept what makes Fuuka best girl.

<h2>What Makes Fuuka Best Grill?</h2>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>
First off, she looks fucking adorable. Just look at the image at the top of this page, or this adorable shit.
</p>
<img src = "1.jpg"; width = '25%'>
<p>Even her older design from P4U looks fucking adorable,<br>
which can't be said for the others. (Aigis Doesn't count since shes a fucking robot)</p>
<img src = "2.jpg"; width = '25%'>
<p>
She even has a bit of sex appeal, which is illustrated by this body pillow.<br>
She isn't even a robot so it's not that creepy!

<h2>Personality Traits</h2>
<div class = "par">
<p>
In terms of personality, she's still fucking adorable.<br>
In the scene where she unlocks her persona, her entire motivation to do anything<br>
is literally to protect the person, who in the past, had basically been an asshole to her<br>
and was technically the entire reason whe was in the situation in the first place.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
also worth noting is that she just shoots herself with no hesitation<br>
unlike the inferior Yukari, she just fucking gets it.

Some people argue that Fuuka isn't as <b>deep</b> as the other girls, as she doesn't have any<br>
emo backstories. Yukari has a dead dad, Mitsuru has an edgy dad that also dies, and to most, fuuka has nothing<br>
To y'all who agree to that statement, <b>FUCK YOU!</b> First off, she sort of does have an emo backstory<br>
as she states multiple times that her parents aren't exactly the best, and that she prefers to stay with<br>
SEES in the dorm. Even then, Fuuka is good enough to stand alone as best grill without an edgy backstory.<br>
<br>
Her social link is probably the most wholesome thing of all time, where she does what<br>
none of the P4 grills could do, and learns how to actually make edible food.<br>
Her motivation for this is literally to be useful to SEES, and to thank them for<br>
letting her stay with them, and that is just fucking adorable. Through this,<br>
You can see how much she genuinely cares about SEES, and just the people around her in general.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<div class = "par">
<p>
Fuuka is best girl mainly because of how adorable she is.<br>
Her personality is extremely wholesome, and literally everything she does<br>
is motivated by her will to make people happy. She's also not a shitty android so yeah.
